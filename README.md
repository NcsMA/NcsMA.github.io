#### Endpoint: Would a client churn or not?
* [Source](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shrutimechlearn/churn-modelling)
* Acurracy on the Model: 83%
* Moldels on the test: Logistic Regresssion, Random Florest, KNN, Decision Tree, SVM
* Best predictive Model on the project: Random Florest
* Language: Python

## Descriptive Projects
### Project 1 - Clients Count based on Contracts Historic
#### Endpoint: Discover how many active clients the company has monthly and build a report on Power Bi
* Source
* Processing steps:
  * Fixes on Historical Contracts - divide the contracts by type and dates readjustment
  * Contracts and Accounts Deduplicate

  * Churn validation between the months 
* Language: Python

### Project 2 - New Clients Follow Up
#### Endpoint: Discover how many clients new clients the company had monthly and build a report on Power Bi
* Source
* Processing steps:
  * Data Cleaning for inconsistencies
  * Set new client based on first contract inicial data
* Language: SQL

### Project 3 - Pareto Curve View Develpment on Power Bi (ABC Curve)
#### Endpoint: Group customers based on the financial value invested in the company into total accumulated ranges
* Source
* Processing steps:
  * Data Cleaning for inconsistencies
  * Create ranges and the percentage of accumulated value rates
  * Divide clientes by their ranges of amounts accumulated in contracts
* Language: Python
